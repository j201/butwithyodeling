##Making

You'll need browserify to build this. To get it, you'll need [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), which comes with [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) but can also be used with [io.js](https://iojs.org/en/index.html). Then, run the following to install browserify and other packages:

```
npm install
```

Then, to build,

```
npm run build
```

Alternately, to automatically update built files when you change them, run:

```
npm run watch
```

##Running

Once you have a build or are watching, run the following for a dev server:

```
npm start
```
